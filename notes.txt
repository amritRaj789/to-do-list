This is me trying to learn React from Brad's Youtube course.
He won't be using React Hooks or Context API
We will be creating a Todo list

We will be using Axios instead of Fetch API



Important points learned:
//Functional components can use state only by using React Hooks
//If you want to install CRA without making a new folder but inside your current directory then use this command: $ npx create-react-app .

// Context API: Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level

// Serviceworkers are used for Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) stuff

//Render is the lifecycle method

//PropTypes are a sort of validation about our components' props. what prop types can they have . If they are required or not. As your app grows. you can catch a lot of bugs with typechecking. For some applications you can use JS extensions like FLow or TypeScript. But even if you don't use those, React has some built-in typechecking abilities.

//Use react-router-dom package to add basic routing functionalities to your react page

//In React while using Router, you cannot have a <a> (anchor tag). You need to instead use a link tag
