This is me trying to learn React from Brad's Youtube course.
He won't be using React Hooks or Context API
We will be creating a Todo list


Important points learned:
//Functional components can use state only by using React Hooks
//If you want to install CRA without making a new folder but inside your current directory then use this command: $ npx create-react-app .

// Context API: Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level

// Serviceworkers are used for Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) stuff

//Render is the lifecycle method
